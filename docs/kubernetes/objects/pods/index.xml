      <description>Labels Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to objects, such as pods that help to identify that object.
Selectors Label Selectors help client/user identify a set of objects.

      <description>Node Affinity and Anti-Affinity The affinity/anti-affinity feature, greatly expands the types of constraints you can express. The key enhancements are
 the language is more expressive (not just “AND of exact match”) you can indicate that the rule is “soft”/“preference” rather than a hard requirement, so if the scheduler can’t satisfy it, the pod will still be scheduled you can constrain against labels on other pods running on the node (or other topological domain), rather than against labels on the node itself, which allows rules about which pods can and cannot be co-located  The manfifest reads as: &amp;ldquo;If there are no nodes labelled as apple, then still schedule the pod to a node&amp;rdquo;</description>
